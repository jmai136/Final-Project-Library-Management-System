# Final Project - Library Management System
```
Project Overview
In this project, you will build a simulated library management system where users can borrow and return books. The project requires implementing various data structures to manage different tasks within the library system, such as tracking available books, managing borrowed books, handling waitlists for popular books, and performing book searches.

The project should be broken down into daily tasks, each focusing on implementing and utilizing a specific data structure in C#.

Learning Objectives
Understand and implement queues to manage book waitlists.
Utilize stacks to track user borrowing and returning history.
Apply recursion to search for books by specific criteria.
Use linked lists for managing dynamically growing lists of books.
Create and utilize a binary search tree (BST) to perform efficient book lookups by ISBN or title.
Develop an understanding of when and why to use specific data structures in a real-world application.
Project Requirements
Library Database:

Create a collection of books, each with attributes like Title, Author, ISBN, and AvailableCopies.
Use a LinkedList to represent the library's catalog so that books can be added or removed dynamically.
Book Borrowing System:

Use a Stack to maintain a borrowing history for each user. This stack allows users to “undo” or review their borrowing actions.
Waitlist System:

Implement a Queue to handle waitlists for books that are currently borrowed out.
If a book is not available, users can be added to the book’s waitlist, and they will be notified (simulated by console output) when the book becomes available.
Book Search:

Use a Binary Search Tree (BST) to enable
This is your final project it is worth 35% of your grade, each section is worth 25% of the overall grade, you may work together in groups to complete this task.```
